- Margins (quotes and notes)
- Reading goals
- Account and appearance settings

```

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.12+
- npm
- PostgreSQL

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ColinSnider/Basgiath.git
cd Basgiath
npm install
```

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file (or set environment variables another way):

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=production
```

- `DATABASE_URL` is required.
- `PORT` is optional in local development and is provided automatically by Railway.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start local development server
- `npm run build` - Build client and server bundles
- `npm run build:dev` - Build with development mode
- `npm run start` - Run production server from `dist/`
- `npm run preview` - Preview Vite build output
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run format` - Run Prettier
- `npm run db:push` - Push Drizzle schema to the configured database

## Local development

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running and `DATABASE_URL` is set.
2. Push schema changes if needed:

   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app runs on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Railway deployment

1. Create a new Railway project and connect this repository.
2. Add a PostgreSQL service and copy its `DATABASE_URL` into the app service variables.
3. Deploy. Railway uses `railway.json`:
   - Build: Railpack (`npm install` + `npm run build`)
   - Start: `npm run db:migrate && npm run start`
4. Verify health checks:
   - `GET /healthz`
   - `GET /readyz`

## Troubleshooting

- `DATABASE_URL must be set`: set `DATABASE_URL` on the service before deploy.
- Startup migration failed: confirm the database service is attached and reachable from the app.
- App does not bind correctly: ensure Railway `PORT` is not overridden with an invalid value.
